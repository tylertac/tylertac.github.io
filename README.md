# Tyler Courtenay's Personal Site

This is the main repo for hosting my personal website. I will be updating this intermintantly with side projects, as well as using this as my online portfolio site.

Th this project was initially forked from [Jekyll-Foundation](https://github.com/Foundation-for-Jekyll-sites/jekyll-foundation/wiki/Getting-started)

## Basic commands to get started:

- ```yarn start``` for local environment
- ```yarn build``` (begins the build process)
- Deploys are currently triggered on Netlify (no webhook setup at this time)
